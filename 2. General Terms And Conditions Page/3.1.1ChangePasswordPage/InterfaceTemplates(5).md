| The Change Password form includes the fields: 1) Old password 2) New password 3) Confirm new password (All TextBox types) FR1 | On the Change Password page, the User enters their old password (8 to 20 characters), new password (8 to 20 characters), and repeats the new password (8 to 20 characters) into the fields. When all fields have been entered, the Save button is highlighted. | ![ChangePasswordForm](image.png) | GET /ChangePasswordForm |
| Save Button (Push Type) FR5 | When the User fills in the fields of the Change Password form, the Save button is activated. When this button is clicked, the Old Password entered in the field is compared with the details saved in the database (FR2). If the passwords match, a confirmation link is sent to the User's email (FR8) and a message about this event is issued. When the User clicks on the link sent to the email, he is redirected to the Login page for new authentication (FR9). All Application sessions opened up to this point are closed (FR15, FR18). A message about a successful password change is issued. The fact of an attempt to change the password is saved in the corresponding Application log (FR7). If the old passwords do not match, a message about an incorrect password is issued (FR10). | ![SaveButton](image-1.png) | GET /SaveButton |
